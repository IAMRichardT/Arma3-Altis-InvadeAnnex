Earn every resource, weapon and ammunition to gather enough assets in order to be a real challenge for the enemy. In the meantime, disturb its operations and gain support from NATO."]];

The citizens of each town support AAF or FIA in some amount. The dominant faction is the one who owns the city and benefits of their support in Money and Human Resources. Your actions may low AAF Support or raise yours, or both. Killing enemies, accomplishing missions, conquering resources and power-stations affect the amount of citizen support."]];
